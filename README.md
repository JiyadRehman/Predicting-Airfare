# Predicting-Airfare
Based on the data collected by major airline we would see whether a model can help predicting the fare for a route.

The data file Airfare  contains real data that were collected for the third quarter of 1996 (Data file is not shared).
They consist of the predictors and response listed in the project report. 
Note that some cities are served by more than one airport, and in those cases the airports are distinguished by their three-letter code.

I did multiple analysis and then developed two models and compared their performance the results and steps are shared in the project report.
